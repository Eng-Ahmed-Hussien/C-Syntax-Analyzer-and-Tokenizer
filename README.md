# Programming Language Tools Repository

This repository contains two educational tools for analyzing and parsing programming languages. Each project focuses on a unique aspect of language processing, offering features to aid learning and understanding of syntax analysis and parsing.

## Projects

   - A Python script to analyze C code for syntax errors and tokenize it into various components like keywords, operators, and identifiers.
   - Provides detailed feedback and error detection for beginner programmers.

2. [**Top-Down Parser for Context-Free Grammars**](Top-Down-Parser/README.md)
   - A Python-based recursive descent parser that checks strings against context-free grammar rules.
   - Features grammar validation, interactive inputs, and parse tree visualization.
